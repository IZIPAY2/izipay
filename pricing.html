                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This page outlines the fees applicable at various stages for the use of IZI Pay cards. These fees support the operation and maintenance of our services.</p>
    
                <h2>Top-Up Fees</h2>
                <p>A top-up fee is incurred when cryptocurrency is transferred to an IZI Pay card balance. This fee covers the conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency. IZI Pay applies a top-up fee of 2.5% per transaction.</p>
    
                <h2>Transaction Fees</h2>
                <p>IZI Pay does not impose any transaction fees. However, fees may be charged by merchants or payment processors, which are beyond our control and may vary depending on the merchant’s policies.</p>
    
                <h2>Service Fee</h2>
                <p>To ensure continuous service improvements and system upgrades, IZI Pay applies a monthly service fee of USD 2. This fee is automatically deducted at the beginning of each month.
                    • If the available balance is insufficient, users will receive a notification from our support team with a reminder to top up their balance.
                    • As an alternative, users may choose to temporarily freeze their card if they do not intend to use it.</p>
    
                <h2>General Provisions</h2>
                <p>All fees are subject to change at IZI Pay’s discretion. In the event of any changes, users will be notified via email, and updates will be reflected on this page.</p>
